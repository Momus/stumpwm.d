#Initialization files for StumpWM

## Target

This config was initially written for StumpWM version 0.9.9 This verion supported the reading of `~/.stumpwm.d/init.el` by default, so `.stumpwmrc` is ommited.


##Notes

1. Remapping the prefix key:
    * I mapped the prefix key to C-F12 because that seems like the least-likely combination to come up in an application.
    * Since I use a Kenisis programmable keyboard, I mapped the CapsLock key to the Win key, then added the macro of pressing C-F20
    to be mapped to CapsLock.  Thus the Winkey becomes the prefix key without muddling about with Xmodmap files, which GDM on Fedora has
    real problems with anyway.

These files have been tested on one and only one machine so far, so do with them what you will.
